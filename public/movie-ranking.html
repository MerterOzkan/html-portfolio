<h1>The Best Movies According to Merter</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club.</p>
<h3>The Silence of the Lambs</h3>
<p>This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and gore to have a good suspense film.</p>
<h3>Psycho</h3>
<p> A Hitchcock Masterpiece.</p>
